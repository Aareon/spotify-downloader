# Spotify-Downloader

- Download songs from YouTube in an MP3 format by using Spotify's HTTP link.

- Can also download a song by entering its artist and song name (in case if you don't have the Spotify's HTTP link for some song).

- Downloading a song using a Spotify link will automatically fix meta-tags and add a nice albumart to the song.

That's how your Music library will look like!

## Installation & Usage:

### Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac:
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader
cd Spotify-Downloader
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
You'll also need to install avconv:

`sudo apt-get install libav-tools`

Use `sudo python spotdl.py` to launch the script.

### Windows:

Assuming you have python already installed..

- Download Libav-Tools for windows: https://builds.libav.org/windows/release-gpl/libav-x86_64-w64-mingw32-11.7.7z. Copy all the contents of bin folder (of avconv) to Scripts folder (in your python's installation directory)

- Download the zip file of this repository and extract its contents in your python's installation folder as well.

Shift+right-click on empty area and open cmd and type:

`"Scripts/pip.exe" install -U -r requirements.txt`

Now to run the script type:

`python.exe spotdl.py`

(you can create a batch file shortcut to run the script just by double-click anytime)

## Instructions for Downloading Songs:

- Launch the script using the above command as mentioned for your OS.

- For available options, run `sudo python spotdl.py --help`.

#### Downloading by Name:

For example:

- We want to download Hello by Adele, simply run the script and type `adele hello`.

- The script will automatically look for the best matching song and download it in the folder `Music/` placed in your current directory.

- It will now convert the song to an mp3.

- Now, if we want to check it out the lyrics of that song, just type `lyrics` in the script and it should print out the lyrics for any last downloaded song.

- Okay, lets play the song now. Just type `play` in the script.

#### Downloading by Spotify Link:

For example:

- We want to download the same song (i.e: Hello by Adele) but using Spotify Link this time that looks like  `http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, you can copy it from your Spotify desktop or mobile app by right clicking or long tap on the song and copy HTTP link.

- Now simply paste this link after running the script, it should download Hello by Adele.

- Just like before, it will again convert the song to an mp3.

- Now, that we have used a Spotify link to download the song, the script will automatically fix the meta-tags and add an album-art to the song.

- Similarly, we can now check out its lyrics or play it.

- Just type `exit` to exit out of the script.

#### What if we want to download multiple songs at once?

For example:

- We want to download Hello by Adele, The Nights by Avicci and 21 Guns by Green Day just using a single command.

Also this time we have the Spotify link only for Hello by Adele but not for other two songs.

No problem!

- Just make a list.txt by running the following commands:

```
cd
cd Spotify-Downloader
sudo nano list.txt
```
(if you are on windows, just edit `list.txt` - i.e `C:\Python27\list.txt`)

add all the songs you want to download, in our case it is:

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7
the nights avicci
21 guns green day
```

- Now just run the script and type ```list```, it will automatically start downloading the songs you provided in `list.txt`.

- You can stop downloading songs by hitting `ctrl+c`, the script will automatically resume from the song where you stopped it the next time you want to download the songs using `list`.

- To download all songs in your playlist, just select all the songs `ctrl+a` in Spotify desktop app, copy them `ctrl+c` and paste `ctrl+v` in `list.txt`.

## Brief info on Commands:
```
• play - will play the last song downloaded using mplayer
• list - downloads songs from list.txt
• lyrics - will print out the lyrics for last downloaded song
• exit - exit the script
```
